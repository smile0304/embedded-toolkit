## Individual statically linked executables for MANY architectures and ABIs, most (all?) with soft-float

### Including

* `busybox` (with ALL applications enabled and an "installer" script)
* `gawk` (you may be ok with busybox awk depending on how advanced your task is)
* `gdbserver` (pretty well tested)
* `libpcap` (useful in building tcpdump)
* `lsof` (you may be ok with busybox lsof depending on how advanced your task is)
* `mawk` (you may be ok with busybox awk depending on how advanced your task is)
* `tcpdump` (it is nice to see what leaves a WAN port isn't it?)
* `tsh` (not well tested, a remote access tool with encryption)
